# Design challenge
## General info
This is a solution for the homework assignment. The purpose of the app is to display car offerings within a webpage. I have implemented only the frontend part (sorting, search, the pages behind links are not implemented). This includes all relevant react code with the CSS. I have also implemented a basic responsive view.

Technology wise, I used React with functional components. For the visual framework, I chose material ui. I think it allows for a clean, modern design that also matches well with the provided wireframes.

I mostly aimed to follow the provided guidelines: I aimed for high fidelity to the wireframes as well as using the provided color scheme. When I had doubts or needed inspiration, I checked the truckoo website and used that as a guideline.

## Setup

To run the project locally, in the project directory run: 

`npm install`
to install all the dependencies for the app.

Run `npm start` to start the app in development mode. 
By default, the app will run on port 3000. Go to the URL http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

`npm run build` to build the app for production to the build folder.
